# Quick Manual Testing Checklist for Secure Media

## ‚úÖ Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variable `EXTERNAL_SYSTEM_API_KEY` is set on Railway
- [ ] Code is deployed to Railway
- [ ] Application is running without errors

## üß™ Manual Tests (5 minutes)

### Test 1: Frontend Still Works ‚úÖ
1. Log into your frontend application
2. Navigate to employee profiles
3. Check if profile images load correctly
4. Navigate to tickets with attachments
5. Check if attachment links work

**Expected**: Everything works normally

### Test 2: Direct URL Access is Blocked üö´
1. While logged in, right-click an attachment link
2. Copy the URL (should look like: `https://smartsupport-hdts-backend.up.railway.app/media/ticket_attachments/file.pdf?token=...`)
3. Remove the `?token=...` part
4. Open the shortened URL in a new incognito window
5. Try to access: `https://smartsupport-hdts-backend.up.railway.app/media/ticket_attachments/file.pdf`

**Expected**: 403 Forbidden or authentication error

### Test 3: API Key Access Works üîë
1. Get your `EXTERNAL_SYSTEM_API_KEY` from Railway environment variables
2. Take the same URL from Test 2
3. Add your API key: `https://smartsupport-hdts-backend.up.railway.app/media/ticket_attachments/file.pdf?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
4. Access this URL

**Expected**: File should download/display

### Test 4: Check Developer Tools üîç
1. Open your frontend application
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Navigate to a page with images/attachments
5. Look at the media requests

**Expected**: All media URLs should include `?token=...` parameters

### Test 5: Cross-User Access (If you have multiple test accounts) üë•
1. Log in as Employee A
2. Create/find a ticket with attachments
3. Copy an attachment URL
4. Log in as Employee B
5. Try to access Employee A's attachment URL

**Expected**: Should be blocked unless Employee B is admin/coordinator

## üö® What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs:
- Frontend works normally
- Direct media URLs are blocked
- API key access works
- Media URLs include tokens
- Different users can't access each other's files

### ‚ùå Bad Signs:
- Direct media URLs work without authentication
- Media URLs don't include tokens
- Any user can access any file
- 500 server errors

## üìû Quick Test URLs

Replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your actual Railway URL:

### Should be BLOCKED:
```
https://YOUR_DOMAIN/media/employee_images/some-image.jpg
https://YOUR_DOMAIN/media/ticket_attachments/some-file.pdf
```

### Should WORK (with valid token):
```
https://YOUR_DOMAIN/media/employee_images/some-image.jpg?token=VALID_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Should WORK (with valid API key):
```
https://YOUR_DOMAIN/media/ticket_attachments/some-file.pdf?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## üõ†Ô∏è If Something's Wrong

1. **Check Railway logs** for errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set
3. **Check if DEBUG=False** in production
4. **Restart the Railway service**
5. **Review the code changes** were deployed

## üì± Mobile/Different Browser Test

Test on different devices/browsers to ensure:
- Images load on mobile
- Downloads work on different browsers
- Authentication works across platforms

---

**Total time needed: ~5-10 minutes for basic verification**
